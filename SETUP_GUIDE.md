# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide - PHP Backend Integration

## ✅ **Step 1: Start XAMPP**
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** services
3. Make sure both services show "Running" status

## ✅ **Step 2: Setup Database**
1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost/fck/backend/setup/install.php`
2. This will automatically:
   - Create the database `safety_campaign_db`
   - Create all necessary tables
   - Insert sample data
   - Set up demo users

## ✅ **Step 3: Test Your Application**

### 🔐 **Login Page**
- Go to: `http://localhost/fck/login.html`
- Use these demo accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|--------|----------|
| Campaign Manager | john.doe@safetycampaign.org | demo123 |
| Content Creator | jane.smith@safetycampaign.org | demo123 |
| Data Analyst | mike.johnson@safetycampaign.org | demo123 |
| Administrator | admin@safetycampaign.org | admin123 |

### 🏠 **Dashboard**
- After login, you'll be redirected to: `http://localhost/fck/index.html`
- The dashboard will now show:
  - ✅ Real campaign data from the database
  - ✅ Live statistics and metrics
  - ✅ User profile information
  - ✅ Notifications from the database
  - ✅ Interactive charts with real data

## 🔧 **What's Now Working**

### **Frontend ↔ Backend Integration:**
- ✅ **Authentication**: Real login with database verification
- ✅ **Dashboard Data**: Live statistics from MySQL database
- ✅ **User Profiles**: Real user data with profile management
- ✅ **Notifications**: Database-driven notification system
- ✅ **Campaigns**: Real campaign data with CRUD operations
- ✅ **Events**: Event management with database storage
- ✅ **Content**: Content repository with file tracking

### **Fallback System:**
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: If API fails, uses demo data
- ✅ **Offline Mode**: Works without database connection
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management

## 🎯 **Key Features Added**

1. **Backend Integration Script** (`backend-integration.js`):
   - Automatic authentication checking
   - API request handling with token management
   - User interface updates with real data
   - Notification management

2. **Enhanced Frontend** (`index.html`):
   - Authentication-aware interface
   - Real-time data binding
   - User profile integration
   - Notification system

3. **Improved JavaScript** (`index.js`):
   - API-driven dashboard data
   - Database integration for charts
   - Real-time statistics updates

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Database Connection Issues:**
- Ensure MySQL is running in XAMPP
- Check that port 3306 is not blocked
- Verify database credentials in `backend/config/database.php`

### **API Errors:**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure Apache is running on port 80
- Verify PHP files are accessible

### **Login Issues:**
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Try demo credentials exactly as provided
- Check that database setup completed successfully

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ Login redirects to dashboard after authentication
- ✅ Dashboard shows real campaign numbers
- ✅ User profile displays your logged-in information
- ✅ Notifications badge shows actual count
- ✅ Charts display database-driven data

Your system now includes these tables:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `campaigns` - Campaign management
- `events` - Event tracking and registration
- `content` - Content repository
- `notifications` - User notifications
- `audience_segments` - Audience targeting
